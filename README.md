WorldWide Cuisine Quest

Core Features:
WorldWide Cuisine Quest is a webpage that displays different dish cards complete with dish names, images, cuisine categories, and recipes. These webpage elements are populated through TheMealDB API, a self described "open, crowd-sourced database of recipes from around the world."

When the user clicks on a dish card's "recipe" button, the corresponding recipe for that dish is revealed.

A comment section is included to each card, allowing users to express themselves and write about thier experience making their meal.
